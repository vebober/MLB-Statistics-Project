Adding the DH league wide would increase the amount of Runs scored, Home Runs, and reduce the amount of Shutouts.

Since the only rule difference between the American League and the National League is the DH. Any difference in outcome can be attributed by a great degree to this rule difference. On average, the American league scores .303 more runs per game with the DH. Projected over a 162 game season, that equates to 49 more runs per team in the national league. Over 15 teams, this would add 735 more runs to baseball leading to more action and excitement in the game
